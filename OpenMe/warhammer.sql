They can be downloaded free from Steam here. Tretch\'s formidable repertoire of underhanded skills, combined with his famously good luck, has led to a number of legendary deeds!\r\n\r\nTretch began his rise from anonymity when his Clawpack was leading a long line of Night Goblins back to Crookback Mountain. Ostensibly, the Clawleader had chosen Tretch to carry key items of the scavenged loot as a reward for his idea to spike the Goblins\' fungus beer, but it is more likely he was chosen because he was deemed too scrawny to usurp the Clawpack. This proved untrue, as Tretch used a small keg of distilled Mad Cap mushrooms, the stuff that turns Goblins into deranged, spinning lunatics, to great effect. With impeccable timing, Tretch turned his line of slaves into whirling death-dealers just as the Clawleaders and Chieftains were convening to argue over which tunnel to take. The effect of multiple Fanatics chained to each other and attempting to twirl madly in a packed tunnel was spectacularly bloody.\r\n\r\nAfter that incident the Clawpack needed a new leader and Tretch was first to scurry into the gap. Since those days, he has led countless ambushes and proven himself a master survivor. It was Tretch that found the hidden path to attack the flank of the Dwarf gunline at the Battle of Black Crag; Tretch who led the raid that tunnelled beneath the camp of mighty Black Orc Warlord Dagbad and every single Goblin out from underneath the Scourge of the Dark Lands; Tretch was the only Skaven to escape the sinking of the Imperial Galleon captured on the River Aver.\r\n\r\nThe detractors who jealously eye his rapid rise begin to get tail-twitchingly excited when they see Tretch\'s Clawpack flee the battle, wreathed in the fireball of a Weapon Team malfunction, or mauled by enemy formations. However, time after time, Tretch reappears, having left his doomed brethren and popped up elsewhere to accomplish some notable feat.', '↑ Anti-Large: Anti-large units have an advantage against targets that are at least as large as a horse.

It is led by Throt the Unclean and can be found in the northeastern parts of the Old World in the Mortal Empires campaign and in the very northern parts of Naggaroth in the Eye of the Vortex campaign.', 'Clan Moulder is one of the Four Great Skaven Clans which specializes in the mastery of breeding, mutating, and surgically creating some of the most horrific and fearsome war-beasts to have ever existed. Such is the demand for these ferocious creations that Clan Moulder is one of the wealthiest of all Skaven Clans. While many are jealous of Clan Moulder\'s might, few dare to openly challenge them, not when the clan can field an entire army of grotesquely mutated war-beasts.\r\n\r\nThe loathsome stronghold of Clan Moulder, known as Hell Pit, lies deep within the Northern Wastes. The many foul creatures that roam this land provide the raw material used in the clan\'s breeding pits, skin forges, and flesh laboratories. The Clan Moulder spine-rune is a common brand amongst the clan\'s Packmasters, as are symbols of the glowing-green rat, and crude renderings of the whips and prodders used to goad the beasts that have made the clan infamous.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the respect and awe the other Clans feel towards Clan Moulder is well-deserved. Their twisted creations enhanced Moulder’s prestige and influence in the Under-Empire, but it is whispered amongst the other Skaven that this Clan plots something else, something far more dangerous and sinister. Whatever it is, none can say with authority, but the sudden surge of new and terrifying creations spilling out from Hell Pit has more than one Skaven Clan nervous.', 'The ratmen of Clan Moulder are responsible for monstrosities such as:\r\n\r\nWolf Rats\r\nWolf Rats (Poison)\r\nBrood Horrors\r\nRat Ogres\r\nMutant Rat Ogres\r\nBonebreakers\r\nHell Pit Abominations', 'Suitable Climate: Frozen\r\nHas access to Clan Moulder Flesh Laboratory\r\nHitpoints +10% (all characters)\r\nImmune to mountain attrition\r\nConstruction cost -50% for Breeding Stock, Pits of the Packmasters, Force-Feeding Chambers and Laboratory buildings\r\nHas access to a special Hero, Ghoritch.\r\n\r\nDiplomacy\r\nVortex: Starts at war with Ghrond\r\n\r\nMortal Empires: Starts at war with Kraka Drak\r\n\r\nDiplomatic traits:\r\nMortal Empires:\r\n ?\r\nEye of the Vortex (before Twisted and Twilight):\r\nSpineless\r\nRuin-Dweller', 'In Vortex, the player spawns in the far north of Naggaroth, close to Malekith and Hellebron. Due to the narrative of this campaign being to disrupt Ariel\'s ritual, there are significantly more Wood Elf faction nearby that are unique to this campaign.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the Vortex campaign, take Ashrak from Ghrond, colonize at level 3, and build a Weapons Burrow early and get at least 3 Warpfire Throwers and 2 Ratling Guns. Also repair the barracks and upgrade to get a Skaven Chieftain, then take Ghrond, before pushing your first Wood Elf Standing Stone settlement. Warpfire Throwers will hard carry these battles as the garrisons tend to rush a lot of tree spirits into your lines, and the fire damage weakness will let you break their centre quicker than ratling guns do and at lower cost. However you need 2 Ratling Guns to deal with the guaranteed Hawkriders you\'ll see. Garrisons will have 2 at least, while the expeditions have 2-3 and often a unit of Glade Rider Archers, which Warpfire Throwers will struggle against.\r\n\r\nEvery time you destroy one of the Standing Stones, an expedition force will start attacking your settlements. Don\'t pay for a standing army there, instead recruit two lords, give them the Skavenslaves and whatever else you get from the Growth Vat and you should be able to deal with the armies. Though do consider recruiting a few Warpfire Throwers or Ratling Gun units on hard, on legendary you will actually need a standing army spec\'d to fight Wood Elves. Consider keeping positive relations with Har Ganeth and Naggarond so you can roam the continent and not worry about your neighbours, however Naggarond will almost never grant Military Access, so be prepared to gift them gold to stay positive.\r\n\r\nLastly the Flesh Laboratory upgrades allow for some interesting unit customizations, as you need to apply lower level upgrades to unlock better ones, I recommend dumping a bunch of upgrades onto Skavenslaves and Wolf Rats and then recycling them. Units that have the mutation debuff lose health in battle and get huge penalties to replenishment so don\'t pump your starting Brood Horror or Stormvermin unless you\'re able to replace them. A very strong early upgrade is to put vanguard deployment on your Brood Horror and Rat Ogres, and then deploy them for surprise rear attacks with Wolf Rats. Another good choice is at the top of the unit\'s tree which grants Perfect Vigour and Regeneration, which is excellent on Gutter Runners, Deathrunners, Plague Monk Censer Bearers, and Stormvermin.\r\n\r\nIn Mortal Empires, they start with only one settlement but have the potential to expand once the forces of Norsca and Warriors of Chaos start their offensive on Kislev and the northeastern Empire provinces, leaving many cities in ruins, excellent for the Skaven to claim.', NULL),

Betray, and you become pus-bag.	„\r\nClan Pestilens is one of the four Greater Clans. Its members are the Plague Monks – the disciples of disease and decay. Clan Pestilens dedicate themselves with insane fervour to spreading corruption in the name of the Great Horned Rat. Pestilens was the first clan to reach Lustria; there, in the hot, fetid conditions, did the disease-ridden ratmen start to overcome the climate to found Clan Pestilens. It wasn’t long before the emergent clan encountered the Lizardmen and an age-old enmity was born. Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen. Their leader is Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, and while he controls the clan from Skavenblight it is Lord Skrolk that remains in Lustria to return Pestilens to greatness.\r\n\r\nLord Skrolk is an affront to nature. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and even the air around him seems to congeal and darken. Skrolk is ancient and blind, but only a fool would mistake his lack of sight for weakness… In battle, Skrolk leads from the front so he can unleash his rabid fury, wielding the Rod of Corruption and reading from the Liber Bubonicus - a tome describing every disease conjured by Pestilens that even the Chaos God, Nurgle, is said to covet. But Skrolk’s greatest asset is and always will be his cunning.

To the West, the Spine of Sotek dwarves and Ironbrow\'s Expedition. To the south, the Cult of Sotek. To the east, The Blessed Dread, and north lies Itza. It is suggested the player takes it slow and play a more defensive role early game. The first order of business is to exterminate the Southern Sentinels. They will be a thorn in your side until removed. South of you is a small settlement called the Sentinel of Time. It is suggested to occupy that before The Blessed Dread does. Once the Southern Sentinels are all dead, make a non agression pact with The Blessed Dread, only to double cross them later. Due to your position, being at war with them would be bad when the dwarves decide to attack. Itza will occasionally ask the player to give them money, as long as they can spare it, comply with them to prevent an early war.\r\n\r\nVictory through attrition, you are the \"Viet Cong\" of Warhammer!\r\n\r\nClan Pestilens excels at weakening foes prior to engagement through rites that become available after constructing certain buildings such as the Pox Cauldron while also spreading corruption. Increasing corruption spawns rebels that are easily defeated for food and experience. Your campaign movement style occurs by Stalking, and allows for many ambush opportunities, the success of which diminishes the inherent weaknesses of the Skaven by not allowing the enemy to properly form up. The foundation of your economy will be Under-Cities with an emphasis of building towards \"ratkin mafia\" which gives an absolutely amazing 50% of the revenue of a territory! A rite which spawns the DOOOOM! Engineer occurs every 30 rounds and can be used to create an Under-City without the need to conquer! Just run to the closest high value province capital and your economy will soon grow tremendously.\r\n\r\nOverall Clan Pestilens and the Skaven in general have very soft infantry. You should consider building towards growth maximization so that newly conquered territories can expand to Tier 3 as soon as possible in order to develop the \"construction cavern.\" This tree allows for the Skaven\'s most valuable asset, artillery. Use disposable lords from your heartland territories to ferry infantry to front lines that have artillery already produced. Sally forth and establish Under-Cities for passive income and intelligence whilst also increasing Skaven Corruption. Corruption is great in that rebel factions double as food and experience for lords. The rite which spawns the Pestilent Scheme Priest should not be overlooked. Not only does it reduce an enemy\'s settlement income and growth, it is spreadable and also buffs Pestilens Skaven that come into contact with it, hence the attritional focus of your warfare style. Your armies are weak and you will lose battles, but the cheap upkeep and easy passive income allows you to win the war by constant pressure and expansion and the inhibition of enemy counter offensives by plagues and income diminishment.', NULL),

Regardless of the faction buffs, Stormvermin are meant to be meat shields and not damage dealers. Therefore, survival until unlocking your high tier units will be a steep uphill struggle.\r\n\r\nTretch himself is fairly weak for a Legendary Lord, so it is imperative that you keep the starting two units of Stormvermin (Sword & Shield) and a Doomwheel alive into the late game. The vanguard deployment for for his entire army should be utilized to better position your units to attack the enemy from multiple sides. Tretch\'s unique lord skills do provide additional buffs to Clanrats and Stormvermin; buffing Skavenslaves is not worth the skill points.\r\n\r\nEye of the Vortex\r\nClan Rictus will be mainly competing with the Dark Elves on Naggaroth for warpstone settlements for the Vortex rituals and eventually for control of the Vortex itself. The Slaughterhorn Tribe will be very difficult to deal with after erecting their herdstone, and will plow through you should you get in the way. Nagarythe, the Heralds of Ariel, and the Exiles of Nehek will also likely declare war with you.\r\n\r\nThey also have different climate preference than most of the other Skaven factions located down south in Lustria or The Southlands. Clan Moulder to the north of Naggarond and Har Ganeth is the exception, and should be allied or confederated with as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMortal Empires\r\nYou will start off in Naggaroth at Hotek\'s Column (as in the Vortex campaign), with the same neighboring factions, except Clan Moulder will be on the other side of the world at Hellpit. Without the race for The Vortex, it is possible to befriend the Dark Elves in Naggaroth, though you\'ll need to do it quickly before they decide to wipe you out instead.\r\n\r\nYou also start with an Under-City at Crookback Mountain, occupied by Rictus Clan-Nest. Summoning a Vermintide army to overthrow them is an extremely risky, but highly worthwhile gambit that will allow you to relocate back home.
